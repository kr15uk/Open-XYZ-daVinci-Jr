# 2004 LCD Mount

2x front panel versions - one with front SD card slot and one without one.

Without one is much easier, doesn't require desoldering SD card reader but will require funny finger bending from the inside or SD extension. Might be best if using Octoprint/ESP3D and have no need to remove SD card per print.

With front SD card slot - more involved mod but makes it more pleasent to use if SD removal is required.
