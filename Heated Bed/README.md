# Jr 110w 9A @12V DIY heated bed

You can do etching or milling.
Used 165x200 PCB clad of eBay to make one.

(You will need to freehand draw trace extensions for terminals before etching)

Bed was generated using someones heated bed generator script in Processing (please post in Issues if you know whos design that was, my apologies, was done good 4-5x years ago)
