# Cura integration

Not necessary anymore. Was a thing when Cura switched to version 2 from v15.04 and didn't had manual machine add option.

Still can be used if you want to have Jr ir setup wizard and have fancy "Ultimaker like" background bed representation.

!!! Regardless either you use manual setup or profile supplied - you will not be able to print direct to Jr or copy gcode files to SD card for print if on stock firmware.

To be able to print generic gcode you will need to use ThreeDub script (not my work) https://gitlab.com/anthem/py-threedub/tree/master
